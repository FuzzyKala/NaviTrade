## Introduction:
Hi, everyone, I'm a beginner trying to do something interesting (at least for me) on GitHub.

This is my first project, I took these two websites [tradingview](https://www.tradingview.com/) and [twelvedata](https://twelvedata.com/login) as references and data inputs, and tried to learn and code something (totally for learning purposes.) 

## demonstration:
- I used a local Javascript file as a server-side script to fetch the data from twelvedata.com.
- Once the "Server.js" is running, it fetches the data and saves it on my http://localhost:8000.
- This script is running on the backend side, which means the user can't see my API key.
- The API key was kept in the ".env" file for security purposes.
